\begin{abstract}
    Homotopy type theory offers the promise of a formal system for the univalent foundations of mathematics. However, if we simply add the univalence axiom to type theory, then we lose the property of canonicity --- that every term computes to a normal form. A computation becomes `stuck' when it reaches the point that it needs to evaluate a proof term that is an application of the univalence axiom. So we wish to find a way to compute with the univalence axiom.

    As a first step, we present here a system of higher-order propositional logic, with a universe Omega of propositions closed under implication and quantification over any simple type over Omega. We add a type $M =_A N$ for any terms $M$, $N$ of type $A$, and two ways to prove an equality: reflexivity, and the univalence axiom. We present reduction relations for this system, and prove the reduction confluent and strongly normalizing on the well-typed terms. 

This proof has been formalised in Agda.  The formalisation provides a general notion of grammar for a syntax with binding and reduction relation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The rules of deduction of a type theory are traditionally justified by a \emph{meaning explanation} \cite{ML:ITT}, in which to know that a given term has a given type is to know that it computes to a \emph{canonical object} of that type.  For such a meaning explanation to be possible, the type theory should have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Confluence} --- The reduction relation should be confluent.
\item \textbf{Normalization} --- Every well-typed term should reduce to a normal form.
\item Every closed normal form of type $A$ is a canonical object of type $A$.
\end{itemize}
From these three properties, we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Canonicity} --- Every term of type $A$ reduces to a unique canonical object of type $A$.
\end{itemize}

It is desirable to have, in addition, \emph{strong normalization}, so that we know that we are free to choose whatever reduction strategy we please.

The \emph{univalence axiom} of Homotopy Type theory (HoTT) \cite{hottbook} breaks the property of canonicity.  It postulates a
constant
\[ \isotoid : A \simeq B \rightarrow A = B \]
that is an inverse to the canonical function $A = B \rightarrow A \simeq B$.  When a computation reaches a point
where we eliminate a path (proof of equality) formed by $\isotoid$, it gets 'stuck'.

As possible solutions to this problem, we may try to do with a weaker property than canonicity, such as \emph{propositional canonicity}.
We may attempt to prove that every closed term of type $\mathbb{N}$ is \emph{propositionally} equal to a numeral, as conjectured by Voevodsky.  Or we may attempt to change the definition of equality to make $\isotoid$ definable\cite{Polonsky14a}, or
shift to an entirely different type theory such as Cubical Type Theory\cite{cchm:cubical}.

We could also try a more conservative approach, and simply attempt to find a reduction relation for a type theory involving $\isotoid$ that satisfies
all three of the properties above.  There seems to be no reason \emph{a priori} to believe this is not possible, but it is difficult to do because
the full Homotopy Type Theory is a complex and interdependent system.  We can tackle the problem by adding univalence to a much simpler system, finding
a well-behaved reduction relation, then doing the same for more and more complex systems, gradually approaching the full strength of HoTT.

In this paper, we present a system we call $\lambda o e$, or predicative higher-order minimal logic.  It is a type theory with two universes: the universe $\Omega$
of \emph{propositions}, and the universe of \emph{types}.  The propositions are closed under $\supset$ (implication) and include $\bot$ (falsehood), and an equality proposition $M =_A N$ for
any type $A$ and terms $M : A$ and $N : A$.  The types include $\Omega$ itself and are closed under $\rightarrow$ (non-dependent function type).

There are two canonical forms for proofs of $M =_\Omega N$.  For any term $M : \Omega$, we have $\reff{M} : M =_\Omega M$.  We also add univalence for this system, in this form:
if $\delta : \phi \supset \psi$ and $\epsilon : \psi \supset\phi$, then $\univ{\phi}{\psi}{\delta}{\epsilon} : \phi =_\Omega \psi$.  

We present a reduction relation for this system, and prove it satisfies confluence (Corollary \ref{cor:confluence}), strong normalization (Corollary \ref{cor:SN}) and canonicity (Corollary \ref{cor:canon}).

For the future, we wish to expand the system with universal quantification, and expand it to a 2-dimensional system (with equations between proofs).
