# A Strongly Normalizing Computation Rule for Univalence in Higher-Order Propositional Logic #

This is a literate Agda formalization of a proof of strong normalization for several systems incorporating a propositional univalence rule.

## TODO ##

Would like to do before talk (time estimate):
1. Rewrite slide on univalence (2)
2. Define propositional canonicity (1)
3. More on the formalization of grammar (3)
1. Finish proofs in MainPropFinal.lagda
